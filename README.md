# HCI Usability & Accessibility Audit and Redesign – College Website

## Overview
This project presents a Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) based usability and
accessibility audit of a college website, followed by low-fidelity redesign
prototypes for the Homepage and Notices & Updates sections.

The goal of this work is to identify interaction issues using established HCI
principles and demonstrate user-centred design improvements.

## Methods
- Nielsen’s Usability Heuristics
- Accessibility evaluation inspired by WCAG guidelines
- Visual hierarchy and cognitive load analysis

## Audit Scope
- Homepage
- Notices & Updates section

## Key Usability Issues Identified
- High cognitive load due to dense information presentation
- Poor visibility of important notices and deadlines
- Inconsistent layout, spacing, and typography
- Limited user control (no filtering or prioritization)
- Weak system feedback for user interactions

## Accessibility Issues Identified
- Low contrast between text and background
- Small font sizes affecting readability
- Limited keyboard navigation support
- Non-semantic structure impacting screen readers

## Redesign Approach
The redesign focuses on:
- Simplifying content structure
- Improving visual hierarchy using card-based layouts
- Highlighting important information through tags and spacing
- Enhancing readability and accessibility

## Outcome
Two redesigned prototypes were created:
- A simplified homepage emphasizing key user actions
- A redesigned notice board improving clarity and prioritization

## Tools Used
- HTML
- CSS

## HCI Principles Applied
- User-centred design
- Nielsen’s usability heuristics
- Accessibility-first design
- Reduction of cognitive load
